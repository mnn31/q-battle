### Project Description

Quantum Battle is an innovative educational web-based game that teaches quantum computing concepts through interactive turn-based battles. Players control "Quantumons" - characters with abilities based on real quantum phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and quantum tunneling. The game uses actual Qiskit quantum circuits to determine move outcomes, making it the first educational game to integrate real quantum computing into gameplay mechanics.

The project combines quantum physics education with engaging gameplay, making complex quantum concepts accessible and fun through character abilities and battle mechanics. Each character represents different quantum phenomena: Bitzy demonstrates superposition states and measurement, Neutrinette showcases quantum entanglement and Bell states, Resona illustrates quantum interference and waveform accumulation, and Higscrozma embodies quantum tunneling through barrier systems. The game features real-time animations, dynamic backgrounds, and a modular architecture that allows for easy expansion with new characters and abilities.

### Project Goals

The primary goal is to create an educational tool that makes quantum computing accessible to students and researchers through gamification. By combining real quantum circuits with engaging gameplay, we aim to teach 6+ quantum computing concepts including superposition, measurement, entanglement, quantum gates, interference, and tunneling. The game serves as both a classroom integration tool for quantum computing courses and a foundation for quantum education research, demonstrating the potential of gamification in making complex scientific concepts approachable and engaging.
