## Moves

### Q-PHOTON GEYSER* (Signature Quantum Move)
- **Description**: Neutrinette's Q-Move. Deals massive damage and collapses the qubit randomly.
- **Base Damage**: 100
- **Quantum Logic**: Requires qubit to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩ state, then collapses it
- **Effect**: High-damage attack with qubit collapse

### GLITCH CLAW
- **Description**: Deals damage and has a chance of healing the user for 20% max HP.
- **Base Damage**: 40
- **Effect**: Damage + 30% chance to heal 20% max HP

### ENTANGLE
- **Description**: Puts the qubit and the enemy's qubit in a state of ENTANGLEMENT with each other if it wasn't previously.
- **Effect**: Creates quantum entanglement between qubits

### SWITCHEROO
- **Description**: Swaps the states of the qubit and the enemy's qubit.
- **Effect**: Exchanges qubit states between player and enemy
