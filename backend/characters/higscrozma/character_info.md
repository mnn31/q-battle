# HIGSCROZMA - Quantum Tunneling Character

## Stats
- **HP**: 110
- **Attack**: 70  
- **Defense**: 25 (extremely low, must use BARRIER to increase)
- **Speed**: 12 (high speed for SHADOW FORCE priority)

## Ability: QUANTUM BULWARK
HIGSCROZMA can utilize up to three QUANTUM BARRIERS, which act like screens which stack up between it and the enemy. Barriers in front of HIGSCROZMA decrease the damage received by 10% per barrier but also decrease the power of moves used by 10%. Barriers behind HIGSCROZMA act like power-ups, increasing the power of moves by 10%. HIGSCROZMA can tunnel between these barriers using moves, which changes the number of barriers in front and behind. The battle starts with exactly three barriers active, with HIGSCROZMA being behind the first barrier.

## Moves

### Q-VOID RIFT
HIGSCROZMA's Q-Move. Deals 64 base damage and additional damage equal to 10% of Defense stat. Heals the user 10% max HP per barrier behind the user, and then shatters all front barriers.

### PRISMATIC LASER
Deals damage and shatters one random barrier. Places the qubit in a state of SUPERPOSITION. (DMG: 96)

### SHADOW FORCE
If the qubit is not in SUPERPOSITION, this move fails. Collapses the qubit. If 0, deals 80 damage. If 1, deals 120 damage. Moves up one barrier. (DMG 0: 80, DMG 1: 120)

### BARRIER
Increases the defense stat by 10 if the maximum number of barriers are active. Creates a new barrier in front of the user's current position if not. Puts the qubit in a state of SUPERPOSITION.

## Quantum Tunneling Mechanic
- **Barrier System**: 3 barriers total, positioned in front/behind HIGSCROZMA
- **Starting Position**: Behind first barrier (2 barriers in front, 0 behind)
- **Barrier Effects**: Front barriers reduce damage taken by 15% each, reduce damage dealt by 15% each
- **Barrier Effects**: Back barriers increase damage dealt by 20% each
- **Tunneling**: Moves can change barrier positioning
