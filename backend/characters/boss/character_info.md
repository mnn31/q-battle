# Singulon - Boss Character

## Character Overview
Singulon is a powerful boss quantumon with advanced quantum mechanics and high HP.

## Stats
- **HP**: 400
- **Attack**: 60
- **Defense**: 80
- **Speed**: 5

## Ability
**QUANTUM MASTERY**
Singulon has mastered quantum mechanics and can manipulate qubit states with precision.

## Moves

### DUALIZE
Puts Singulon's qubit in a state of SUPERPOSITION if it wasn't previously.
- **Type**: Status
- **Base Power**: 0 (no damage)

### HAZE
Resets both Singulon's qubit and the qubit to |0⟩ state.
- **Type**: Status
- **Base Power**: 0 (no damage)

### BULLET MUONS
Deals massive damage if Singulon's qubit is in state of |0⟩, else fails.
- **Type**: Quantum
- **Base Power**: 120
- **Condition**: Requires qubit to be in |0⟩ state

### Q-PRISMATIC LASER
If both qubits are in superposition, deals massive damage, else deals reduced damage.
- **Type**: Quantum
- **Base Power**: 150 (if both qubits in superposition), 60 (otherwise)
- **Condition**: Scales based on quantum state alignment

## Damage Formula
Uses the same RPG formula as all characters:
**Final Damage = (Attack + Base Power) × 0.8 ÷ (Defense × 0.1 + 1)**

## Strategy
Singulon uses quantum state manipulation to set up powerful attacks. The boss will:
1. Use DUALIZE to create superposition states
2. Use HAZE to reset qubit states when needed
3. Use BULLET MUONS for high damage when qubit is |0⟩
4. Use Q-PRISMATIC LASER for maximum damage when both qubits are in superposition

## Weaknesses
- Lower speed means player often goes first
- Moves have specific quantum state requirements
- Can be countered by manipulating qubit states
